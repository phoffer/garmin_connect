# GarminConnect

I wrote this so I could more easily work with data from Garmin Connect. It's not really ready to be a gem, but I wanted to use it in a couple projects, so I'm releasing it for my own convenience. Usage instructions coming soon.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'garmin_connect'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install garmin_connect

## Usage
